Develop a REST Interface for storage and retrieval of charging station data.
The following information needs to be stored per charging station:
• Unique ID (is user-defined)
• Geo-Coordinates
• Zipcode / Postal Code
The interface should provide the following functionality:
• Persist charging stations
• Retrieve/Query charging stations by
◦ ID
◦ Zipcode / Postal Code
Write some test cases (conceptual test cases, not automated tests) that cover the
functionality adequately.
Pay special attention to:
• REST conventions
• Structure of the source code
• OOP and related principles (SOLID, DRY)
• Documentation and comprehensibility
• Quality Assurance
Timebox: 2 hours. The focus of this task is on your ways of working and the structure of your
code. Your do not need to implement all features and your application doesn‘t need to work
without errors.
